# Sqli_Edited_Version
Edited SQLi Audi lab series so that it can work in kali linux with PhpVersion 7+

In latest version of kali we are having PHP version 7.xxx which does not support MySQL functions because it support MySQLi functions.

MySQLi Extension (or simply known as MySQL improved or MySQLi) is a relational database driver that is used mainly in the PHP programming language. 

So i made necessary changes in the original SQLi labs so that it can work in kali linux with PhpVersion 7+

Original SQLi version can be found at
